# CS 485: Strucuture Information Networks Final Research Project

My research partner, Fiona Lau, and I set out to examine the relationship between single twitter user popularity and predicting tweet virality. While there is much research into single instances of virality and the impact of a tweet on a trending topic, there is minimal research that follows social media users over the course of their career in order to understand impact on user. 

The data we chose to analyze comes from a paper titled "Evolution of Retweet Rates in Twitter User Careers: Analysis and Model" by Kiran Garimella and Robert West. In that study, the researchers show a relationship between followers and retweet count but fails to understand the relationsip betweeen a user's viral tweets and followers/retweet count trajectory.

In this paper, we attempt to explore the co-dependent relationship between follower count and retweet count specifically with regards to the impact of a "viral" tweet. Although we failed to find statistical significance with our prediction model, our analysis of new-follower rates gives insight into differences between popular users and average users. In addition, it points to further research into understanding characteristics of tweets that lead to virality for average users.

Note On Data: We chose to use this data because it was the most accurate and longest time-series data following multiple twitter users that we were able to find. We acknowledge that this data is based on some estimations made using the Wayback Machine Internet Archive (https://archive.org/web/).
